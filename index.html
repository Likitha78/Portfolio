			<p class="lead-para"> 
				My name is Pethakamsetty Krishna Sri Likitha, and I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Vignanâ€™s Institution of Information Technology, JNTUK Kakinada. I have a basic foundation in programming languages including C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and data structures. Academically, I have excelled, with a perfect CGPA of 10.0 in primary school at Oxford EM School and a 93% score in secondary school at Sri Chaitanya Junior College. My undergraduate CGPA was 8.47. I have actively participated in technical competitions, winning first place in a poster presentation. My project experience includes creating a portfolio using HTML and CSS, developing games like Snakes and Ladders using Python and Tic Tac Toe using C, and working on practical implementations such as automatic speed control with Arduino Uno and wireless mobile charging. I enjoy playing chess, carroms, and shuttle, which have honed my strategic thinking and teamwork skills. My strengths lie in problem-solving, creative thinking, adaptability, and time management, though I am working on balancing my perfectionist tendencies with efficiency. I am eager to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges and gain hands-on experience in the field.
